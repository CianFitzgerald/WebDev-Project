One moment he's melting hearts with his sweet soul voice; next he's rapping with the flow of a top MC; there he is, leading from the front, throwing shapes around the stage as he sings; now look, he's behind the drums, expertly working his way around the kit." <a href="https://www.irishexaminer.com/lifestyle/arid-30912173.html">Click here for the full review of Anderson.Paaks recent Dublin show!</a> </div>

              <div class="desc">Kenny Beats only recently jumped to the forefront of Hip-Hop as a formidable beat-maker. Releasing a string of joint albums with big artists has only helped validate his position at the top of the rap production game. After wrapping up projects with Rico Nasty and 03 Greedo, Kenny has set his sights on South Florida rapper Denzel Curry for their new project, UNLOCKED.
