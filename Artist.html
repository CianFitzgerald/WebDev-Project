     <td><img src="/images/KDOT.jpeg" alt="" height="150" width="180"></td>
    <td>Hip hop/jazz rap</td>
    <td>Lamar is an unflinchingly honest storyteller who never compromised on either his core sound or his values.
Through the combined powers of his foundational team at Top Dawg Entertainment (TDE), Interscope Records, and the legendary Dr. Dre, Lamar quickly shattered many barriers in commercial music and entertainment that historically plagued both gangster and "conscious" rappers.</td>
